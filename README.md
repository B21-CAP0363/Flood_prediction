Machine Learning : 
The machine learning learning path makes the ML model. We use the Classification model to classify whether will tomorrow be flooding or not. Firstly, we gather all the data from the website https://dataonline.bmkg.go.id/. In this case, we train our model to focus on Jakarta. Therefore, we collect the data from the Tanjung Priok, Kemayoran, and Bogor (since most of Jakarta's flood came from Bogor). We take the data from February 1st - March 1st, 2018;  December 29th, 2019 - January 29th, 2020;  and November 5th, 2020 - April 8th, 2021. After that we combine all the data and submit it to the python environment using Google co-lab. Then we do some data pre-processing and data cleansing on the data and then we try to build the model. After iterations and optimizations, we deploy the model. At last we get the accuracy at about 78 to 80 percent, which is quite high considering that some of the data in BMKG is missing and the climate in Indonesia change frequently.

Cloud Computing : 
From Cloud Computing path, We makes corporate data more secure. Because of its layered infrastructure and intelligent monitoring system that google cloud platform has. And then we run machine learning models more efficiently using some of the google cloud platform service has. For the last we connect the models with android App so that the application can run properly and detect the flood.

The services we used on Google Cloud Platform seemed like Jupyter Notebook in AI Platform to run the machine learning, Cloud SQL and Cloud Storage to manage the database of app, and App Engine to deploy the Android Code. 

Android :
